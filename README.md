### **Hey!** :wave:
I'm just a person that spends a lot of time writing code and spending too much time configuring my Linux.

### **A little about me**
I'm usually writing code in Python, but I also use a good amount of JavaScript. From time to time I write code in Go, C++, or C#, but Python is my go-to. I've only recently started keeping my repositories public, so my projects look pretty slim...

### **Here's some projects of mine**
- [PolybarGameDeals](https://github.com/nkayp/PolybarGameDeals)
- [Github Pages Website](https://github.com/nkayp/nkayp.github.io)
